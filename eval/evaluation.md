# Model Evaluation for Domain-Specific Llama SFT

This document outlines the methodologies and results of evaluating the fine-tuned Llama model for domain-specific Generative AI Q&A.


## Evaluation Strategy: LLM-as-a-Judge

Given the nuanced nature of generative AI outputs and the domain-specific focus, a traditional automated metric-only approach was insufficient. Therefore, we employed an **LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation strategy**, leveraging a highly capable external LLM to assess the quality of responses. This approach allowed for a more qualitative and context-aware assessment of the fine-tuned model's performance.

### Judge LLM:
* **GPT-4.1** was selected as the Judge LLM due to its advanced reasoning capabilities, strong understanding of complex instructions, and ability to provide nuanced evaluations.

### Evaluation Process:
1.  **Test Set Sampling:** A representative subset of unseen Q&A pairs from the held-out test set (as described in `data_preparation.md`) was used for evaluation.
2.  **Response Generation:** Both the **base Llama 3 8B model** and the **fine-tuned Llama model** generated responses for each question in the test subset.
3.  **Judge Prompting:** GPT-4.1 was prompted with the original question, the context (if applicable), and the responses from both the base and fine-tuned models. The prompt explicitly instructed GPT-4.1 to evaluate the responses based on predefined criteria and provide a comparative assessment.
4.  **Rating and Analysis:** GPT-4.1's evaluations were collected and analyzed to derive insights into the performance differences.


## Evaluation Criteria and Metrics

The LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation focused on the following key qualitative criteria, providing a comprehensive assessment of the model's output quality:

1.  **Accuracy:**
    * **Definition:** Measures the factual correctness of the generated response. Does the answer contain verifiable information that is true within the Generative AI domain?
    * **Assessment:** GPT-4.1 assessed whether the response was factually precise and free from hallucinations or misinformation.

2.  **Comprehensiveness:**
    * **Definition:** Evaluates whether the response provides a complete and holistic answer to the question, covering all necessary aspects without being overly verbose.
    * **Assessment:** GPT-4.1 judged if the answer adequately addressed all parts of the query and provided sufficient information for a thorough understanding.


## Results and Qualitative Improvements

The LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation demonstrated **significant qualitative improvements and stronger domain-specific alignment** in the fine-tuned Llama model compared to the base model.

* **Improved Accuracy:** The fine-tuned model consistently produced more factually correct responses, especially for nuanced or specific queries within Prompt Engineering, Foundation Models, Agentic AI, and Responsible AI. Instances of hallucinations observed in the base model were notably reduced.
* **Enhanced Comprehensiveness:** Responses from the fine-tuned model were generally more complete, addressing various facets of a question without requiring follow-up queries.
* **Optimal Level of Detail:** The fine-tuned model showed a better ability to provide an appropriate level of detail, avoiding overly simplistic answers while also being more concise than the base model when extensive detail was not required.
* **Stronger Domain Alignment:** The language, terminology, and contextual understanding in the fine-tuned model's responses were significantly more aligned with the Generative AI domain, making the answers more relevant and useful to domain experts.


## Limitations of LLM-as-a-Judge

While powerful, the LLM-as-a-Judge approach has inherent limitations:

* **Subjectivity:** Despite clear guidelines, there can be some level of subjectivity in the judge LLM's interpretation.
* **Cost and Speed:** Running extensive evaluations with a powerful LLM like GPT-4.1 can be computationally intensive and time-consuming.
* **Bias of Judge LLM:** The judge LLM itself may carry biases from its training data, which could subtly influence its judgments.
